# Learn Kubernetes with exercises

On this repository you will find 5 exercises that will help you learn Kubernetes.
You will start by deploying a simple MySQL container on a Kubernetes cluster and then evolve toward having a full WordPress application deployed that is resilient to container outages.

**Pre-Requisites**: In order to do those exercises, you will need to have a Kubernetes Cluster deployed and have the ```kubectl``` command installed on your machine. 

You will find how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on this page [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough)
