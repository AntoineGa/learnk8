# Exercise 6 - Create a chart for your application #

In the previous exercises you have created a YAML definition for the wordpress application. In this exercise, you will package it and make it configurable at deployment time using helm.

Helm separates the definition of the application with the values, simplifying the deployment of the application for multiple environments.
At the end of this exercise, you must be able to connect to your wordpress website and create your blog.

**Note**: It is a good approach to start by intializing a new chart then making the edits based on what you have done in lab #5.
